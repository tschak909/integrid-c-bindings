# integrid-c-bindings

These are C language bindings intended for the UDI version of the Mark Williams C compiler, so that it can utilize the system calls for various CCOS (GRiD-OS) functions.

The functions provided mirror the PL/M versions of each function closely, so the GRiD Develop documentation for PL/M can be used as a reference.

All of the files are in GRiD text format (with resource data at beginning of the file) intended to be opened with GRiDWrite.
